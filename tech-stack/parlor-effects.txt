<small>a slowly updated simplified explanation of some of the hardware that goes into my escape rooms</small>


<b>relays:</b> a "thing" that acts as a switch that is switched by a wire that either does or does not have power. Think like a momentary pushbutton switch. When it is [either high or low] the switch will be [open or closed]. Relays are powered by a <i>specific</i> voltage, but can carry any number of voltages.\
I use them in my escape room for things like opening and closing mag locks. Sometimes I use a 5v powered relay to switch a 12v circuit. I have also used a 12v relay to switch a 5v circuit./

<b>reed switches:</b> neat little switches that are triggered  by magnets. Just like a relay, but it doesn't need power, and instead of a pushbutton (or other voltage trigger) it only needs a magnet to go on top of it.\
I use them in my escape rooms when I want you to put a [thing] into/onto/next to [another thing].
